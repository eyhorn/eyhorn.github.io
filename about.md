My name is Alex Eyhorn. I'm senior software engineer at [Planet Innovation](https://planetinnovation.com/) working out of Melbourne office. At work I'm programming in C# and JavaScript.

I live with my wife and our two kids in one of the Melbourne's Eastern suburbs. Before making Australia my home I was living in Kyiv, Ukraine.

In my free time I like to learn new things about programming and technology.  Recently I've started to learn French to be able to read Jules Verne and Alexandre Dumas in the original.

In this blog I will be sharing things that I find useful or interesting.
